Illustrates concepts which can only be demonstrated on multi python file projects,
such as

- imports
- modules
- execfile

Some of the files contain test only stuff but no info. The most informative files are:

- main.py
- a.py

All the tests are run by running `main.py`.

You must execute `main.py` from current dir because some of the examples depend on `os.getcwd`.
