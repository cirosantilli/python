GUI toolkit.

The interface is Part of the stdlib, however Tk is not.
Ubuntu 12.04 interpreted this as Tk is optional, and it not installed by default.
So you should not rely on it being there everywhere...

Tk seems less advanced than GTK/QT, but could be fine for one page GUIs.

The IDLE editor is written on it, and is part of the stdlib too.
