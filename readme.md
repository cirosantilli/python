My simple python scripts.

I may have more python code in other repos, which are organized in a more project wise manner.

There is lots of crap here since at least half of this repo is a sandbox.
For scripts which I think may be worth your while, please check the [Featured][] section.

Since I don't expect others to install all the scrips in this folder,
I will try to give installation procedures on a file-by-file basis for scrips that have dependencies,
instead of a setup.py file.

This section showcases scripts which I think might be worth your while.

Is a script is not here, it may be total trash (due lack of tests, or pure noobiness =) )
