my simple python scripts and cheats.

larger projects may be put into a repo of their own.

# finding good stuff

a lot of stuff in this repo is a sandbox.

to find the better stuff do:
    
    grep -Er '^#\?note=[7-9]'

for directories that are modules, metadata is stored in the `__init__.py`
and for other dirs, in `readme.md` file.
