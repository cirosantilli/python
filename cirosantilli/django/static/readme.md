- app : applications downloaded from the internet, possibly modified by me.

    only used files are kept to be uploaded and served.

    original app directory structure is mirrored, so that to dev/test the original app,
    all that is needed is to rename my the application folder to appfolder.my, and mv
    or symlink the origin application dir here named appfolder.

    version numbers are removed from application directories.

    I shall use .orig preffix for my applications while testing the original,
    and .my when using my personal (not to be pulled) version
